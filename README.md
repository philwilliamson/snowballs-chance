# WIP - Snowball's Chance

An arcade-style on-rails flight game where you play as a snowball ascending out of an infernal dimension, avoiding obstacles along the way. 

This game was developed for the [Game Off 2022](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022) game jam hosted by GitHub. It's based on the clich√© "(a) snowball's chance in hell".

Built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
